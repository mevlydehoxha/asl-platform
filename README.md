Learning a new language is an enriching experience. The lack of resources has made it difficult for Albanian-speaking people to learn sign language. 
ASL is the primary form of communication for the community of individuals with hearing or speech difficulties and there are different ways of accessing this type of language that enables us to understand and learn it. 
ASL is a sign-based language used by the hearing or speech-impaired community. 
It is a language that provides the principles of communication for over 70,000 Albanian-speaking individuals. 
The characteristics, cultural and historical formation have been preserved over the years to preserve the roots of this language. 
This platform was created to help the community with hearing or speaking difficulties, but also other individuals who do not have these difficulties, to more easily access the learning of sign language. 
The reason why this platform has been chosen to be created on the web is to offer users an easier and faster access to this platform.
ASLP was created using the power of Laravel, ReactJS, MySQL and TensorflowJS.
